# Website permissions opportunity

The website permissions opportunity optimizes website permissions, crucial for maintaining a secure and manageable AEM environment. This opportunity allows you to refine access controls by removing overly broad permissions—such as `jcr:all` on generic paths like `/` or `/content` — and aligning user access with the principle of least privilege. By streamlining permissions and eliminating redundancies, you can reduce security risks, improve maintainability, and prevent future misconfigurations. Take action by reviewing and updating permissions in the AEM Security Permissions console or your code repository, ensuring service users have only the access they truly need.
